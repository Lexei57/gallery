Gallery
==============

A web application to display images on a variety of themes from a resource for the distribution of author's photos.
The application has this functionality:

- Outputs a general feed of images using the Unsplash API. The collection is updated every day. Older photos move on as you move through the photo feed.
- Ability to open an individual selected image to view in a larger format as well as to display detailed information about the photo.
- Display a collection of images by its tag. You can select a tag when viewing an individual image, where in the block of photo information there is a list of tags which can be clicked on to display the collection by tag.
- Search for photos by keyword.
- Displaying images in two different views: 3 columns and 5 columns, between which you can switch by clicking on the switch type of display.

Also, in order to display photos with different aspect ratios more comfortably, the application implements the Masonry grid element technique.
